About Me:<br />
I was born in Princeton, NJ on September 3, 2003. I live with both my parents ins East Brunswick, New Jersey. I have one younger brother who is 3 years younger than me. I like to play sports with my friends such as basketball and football, and I also enjoy leisurly activities such as  going for walks and riding my bike. I participate in various clubs in my school such as Model United Nations, FBLA, and pre-med club. I also volunteer outside of school with East Brunswick Youth Council at various events. Someday, I hope to become a doctor, because I like to help people.
